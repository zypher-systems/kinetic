# fedora-kiwi-descriptions

This project is used to manage the Fedora KIWI image descriptions used in composing Fedora release images.

The `rawhide` branch is used for Fedora Rawhide images and each release branch is used by that release.

All changes should be made via the PR workflow.

## Image variants

Please look at [`VARIANTS`](VARIANTS.md) for details on the available
configurations that can be built.

## Image build quickstart

This is generally tested and expected to run on the latest stable release of Fedora Linux.
Other distributions may work, but there are no guarantees.

Set up your development environment and run the image build (substitute `<image_type>` and `<image_profile>` for the appropriate settings):

```bash
# Install kiwi
[]$ sudo dnf --assumeyes install kiwi kiwi-systemdeps distribution-gpg-keys
# Run the image build
[]$ sudo ./kiwi-build --kiwi-file=Fedora.kiwi --image-type=<image_type> --image-profile=<image_profile> --output-dir ./outdir
```

## CI information

This project is tested using the [Software Factory Zuul CI instance](https://fedora.softwarefactory-project.io/zuul/project/pagure.io/fedora-kiwi-descriptions)
using the [Test Management Tool](https://tmt.readthedocs.io/).

The Zuul configuration is generated from the Jinja2 template `.zuul.yaml.j2`.
When adding or removing a tmt plan, please run the following command to regenerate the Zuul configuration:

```bash
[]$ make generate-zuul-config
```
